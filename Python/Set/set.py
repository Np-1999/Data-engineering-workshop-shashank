# A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. 
# Pythonâ€™s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set. 
# The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized method for checking
#   whether a specific element is contained in the set. This is based on a data structure known as a hash table. 
# Since sets are unordered, we cannot access items using indexes like we do in lists.
# Only instances of immutable types can be added to a Python set
